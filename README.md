#### OSU Bootcamp
This website was used to teach Module 5 (Third_Party APIs). 

***Module 5 skills learned:***
* We learned what third-party libraries are and what purposes they serve.
* We learned how to implement third-party libraries into our application via a CDN.
* We learned how to understand and use a library's documentation when implementing new features.
* We experienced what jQuery has to offer in terms of making DOM manipulation a little bit easier to do.
* We used Bootstrap to save time and frustration by using their pre-built CSS styles.
* We learned how to use jQuery UI for functionality we'd otherwise have to build from scratch.
* We were introduced to the complexities of date and time functionality in JavaScript and how MomentJS can be used to help us in those situations.
* We learned about timed events in JavaScript and how to use callback functions in *setTimeout()* and *setInterval()*.
   * **BONUS**: We also learned that JavaScript deals in milliseconds.
* We reinforced our knowledge of CSS layouts and design.
